/**
 * A protocol defining multiple Record types in a single file, which makes it
 * easier to bundle related Records, and to version schema changes across multiple
 * record types.
 *
 * Design decision: A protocol defines more than just avro types, it defines an RPC exchange
 *   of information between systems. This includes 3 things:
 *     1. Record Types - The data normally exchanged by protocol exchanges
 *     2. Error Types  - The data returned by the protocol methods upon an error
 *     3. RPC Methods  - The method calls provided in the generated client library
 *
 *   In this example, we are exploring patterns for best aligning a variety of error messages
 *   from other systems, not from an avro protocol. Unfortunately, our "Error" types are the
 *   "normal" records exchanged by this protocol, not the protocol errors.
 *
 *   Overloading the type names is regrettably confusing, this example is about demonstrating
 *   how to use an .avdl (Avro Domain-Specific Language) protocol/file to bundle related schemas
 *   together in a more easily managed (and versioned) way.
 *
 *   One of the best parts of this file is that it supports comments (like this one), which is
 *   not (easily) possible in .avsc files, which are just JSON.
